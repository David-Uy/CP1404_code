**Estimates for Practical Tasks:** 
My journey with estimating practical tasks was an evolving one during the course. 
Initially, my accuracy in estimating project timelines and workload was quite modest. 
However, as I progressed and became more attuned to the nuances of project management, 
my accuracy noticeably improved. This improvement was largely due to the lessons I gleaned 
from earlier miscalculations. It underscored the fact that learning from errors is a 
pivotal aspect of enhancing one's estimation skills, illustrating how practice and experience 
are instrumental in this process.

**Code Reviews:** The experiences of both receiving and conducting code reviews were richly 
educational. When my code underwent scrutiny, I learned the pivotal importance of writing 
code that is not only functional but also clean and well-documented. Feedback from reviews 
became a catalyst for my personal growth as a developer. Similarly, when I had the opportunity 
to perform code reviews, I discovered the value of providing constructive feedback in a 
supportive and empathetic manner. It became evident that effective code reviews are a two-way 
street, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

**Practical Tasks Overall:** If entrusted with overseeing the subject, I would consider 
integrating more collaborative projects into the curriculum. Such projects would mirror 
real-world development environments, enabling students to develop essential teamwork and 
communication skills that are indispensable in the professional sphere. Moreover, I would 
emphasize the significance of testing and debugging throughout the course. This would better 
prepare students for the inevitable challenges they will face in their future careers, 
instilling in them a solid foundation in troubleshooting and quality assurance practices.
