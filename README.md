# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions and practice work for CP1404 - Programming II practical exercises at JCU. 

My name is David Uy, and I am a student currently enrolled in the CP1404 course. This repository serves as a record of my practical assignments and the progress I've made in learning Python programming and software development concepts.

## Main Lessons Learned About "Clean Code"

1. **Readability Matters:** Clean code is code that is easy to read and understand. Using meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and consistent coding conventions can greatly enhance code readability.

2. **Keep Functions Small:** Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable functions. This not only makes your code easier to test and debug but also promotes code reusability.

3. **Avoid Code Duplication:** Repeating the same code in multiple places can lead to maintenance headaches. Utilize functions and modules to encapsulate reusable code and minimize duplication.


Feel free to explore the practical exercises and solutions in this repository. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
